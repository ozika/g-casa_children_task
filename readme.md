Task Motivation:
From a very young age, children accumulate a vast amount of knowledge about their surroundings and such knowledge has to be flexibly and adaptively applied to
novel situations (e.g., Booth & Waxman, 2002). Successful generalization of acquired knowledge across different contexts is crucial to make accurate predictions
about what will happen in a novel environment and allow children to behave adaptively (Keresztes et al., 2018). Generalisation depends on the extraction of
regularities across different experiences, and the deployment of such statistical regularities to solve new challenges. Although children show prodigious abilities in
detecting regularities in their surroundings early on (Saffran et al., 1996), there still is a protracted development of the ability to make use of their knowledge in novel
contexts throughout childhood (Ngo et al., 2021) and even well into adolescence (Pudhiyidath et al., 2022). This developmental lag between the acquisition and
application of rules poses an intriguing question: what properties of the learning environments and the novel situations make successful transfer more or less likely?
Here, we will test whether the ability to combine multiple rules – rule combination – is a contributor to the protracted development of rule application observed
across childhood.

Task Discription:
In this task, participants will be told that they will meet many aliens who move in a specific way when hiding,
and their job is to find the hiding spot of each alien. We will teach participants a 6x6 conceptual space made up of 2 dimensions: color and shape. A set of 36 aliens
will occupy every cell in the conceptual space, whose color and shape determine the rule (steps in x/y directions) of how each alien “moves” to their hiding spot.
Participants’ success in the task depends on their abilities to extract the rule pertaining to each dimension and the combination of the two dimensions. After
training a subset of the items on each of the dimensions and finally on both of the dimensions until a learning criterion is reached for each phase, we will test
participants on all untrained aliens to test their abilities to apply the rules to novel exemplars. We will also collect a battery of questionnaires to characterize number
of transdiagnostic individual differences (intolerance of uncertainty) and control measures (impulsivity, general ability).
